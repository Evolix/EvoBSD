# EvoBSD 1.0

EvoBSD is an ansible project used for customising OpenBSD hosts
used by Evolix.

## How to install an OpenBSD machine

**NoteÂ :** The system must be installed with a root account only. Put your public key in the remote root's autorized_keys (/root/.ssh/authorized_keys)

1 - Install ansible's prerequisites

```
ansible-playbook prerequisite.yml -CDi hosts -l HOSTNAME
```

2 - Run it!

```
ansible-playbook evolixisation.yml --ask-vault-pass -CDKi hosts -l HOSTNAME
```

### Try it on a disposable system!

The easiest way to try EvoBSD is by using packer and vmm :

* First of all let's install go and packer on your host system

```
# pkg_add go packer
```

* Then we gonna use [packer-builder-vmm](https://github.com/prep/packer-builder-vmm) project availbale on Github

```
$ go get -u github.com/prep/packer-builder-vmm/cmd/packer-builder-vmm
```

* We have to create a definition file for packer

```
$ vim openbsd.json
```

            "/sbin/halt -p<enter><wait15>"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }


* You need your unprivileged user to be able to run vmctl through doas

```
# echo "permit nopass myunprivilegeduser as root cmd /usr/sbin/vmctl
```

* Eventually you can build your virtual machine

```
$ packer build openbsd.json
```

* Once the building is done, run your VM like this

```
doas vmctl start evobsd -cL -d output-vmm/evobsd.qcow2
```
