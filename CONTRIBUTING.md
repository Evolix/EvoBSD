# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, as long as they respect our current workflow:

1. The master branch is only for releases.  Once properly tested,
the dev branch can be merged, the release tagged and a tar archive
created.

2. The dev branch should never be commited to directly, unless
you're updating the CHANGELOG file.

3. Use feature branches for anything else, once they've passed all
CI tests and have been reviewed by other contributors through a
pull request, they may be merged into the dev branch.


Open issues liberally, but please review closed and opened issues
for duplicates before hand.
